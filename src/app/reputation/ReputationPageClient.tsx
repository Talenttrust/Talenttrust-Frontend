 * - A `cancelled` closure flag plus timer cleanup means an unmounted or
 *   superseded mount can never focus a stale node (concurrent mount/unmount is
 *   safe and cannot produce an inconsistent focus state).
 * - Every failure is observable through the central `reportError` seam and
 *   carries no user data; focus failure is non-fatal to rendering, so no user
 *   data is ever lost.
