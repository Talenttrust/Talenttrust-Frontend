/**
 * WalletAnnouncer — internal component that announces wallet state transitions
 * to assistive technologies through a polite ARIA live region.
 *
 * ## Behaviour
 * - **No mount or rehydration announcement** — the first render and the
 *   subsequent localStorage-rehydration update are both intentionally silent,
 *   so screen-reader users are not interrupted when the page loads (even when
 *   it has a pre-existing session restored from `localStorage`).
 * - **Debounced** — rapid successive address changes (e.g. connect → reconnect
 *   within a short interval) are collapsed into a single announcement after
 *   {@link ANNOUNCE_DEBOUNCE_MS} ms of quiet, preventing queue spam.
 * - **Polite priority** — uses `aria-live="polite"` so the announcement waits
 *   for the user's current utterance to finish rather than interrupting it.
 * - **Atomic** — `aria-atomic="true"` ensures assistive tech reads the full
 *   announcement string, not just the changed portion.
 *
 * ## Announcement copy
 * | Transition          | Announcement                              |
 * |---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
 * | `null` → address    | `"Wallet connected."`                     |
 * | address → `null`    | `"Wallet disconnected."`                  |
 * | address → address   | `"Wallet address changed."` (edge case)   |
 *
 * This component is rendered inside `WalletContext.Provider` so it can
 * consume `useWallet()` and react to context changes without prop-drilling.
 *
 * @param hydratedRef - Ref set to `true` by `WalletProvider` once the initial
 *   `localStorage` rehydration effect has run.  Announcements are suppressed
 *   until this flag is `true` so that restoring a pre-existing session on
 *   page load does not trigger a spurious "Wallet connected." announcement.
 *
 * @internal Not exported; only used inside {@link WalletProvider}.

 * toast notification is shown. Pass `0` (the default) to disable this feature.
