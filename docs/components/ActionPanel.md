# ActionPanel Component

`ActionPanel` renders the contract actions available from the escrow detail page. The component is intentionally built from native `button` controls so actions remain reachable and operable by keyboard without custom key handling.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `status` | `'Active' \| 'Completed' \| 'Disputed' \| 'Pending'` | Yes | Determines which actions are shown and their tab order. |
| `onSubmitMilestone` | `() => void` | No | Callback for submitting milestone work for approval. |
| `onDispute` | `() => void` | No | Callback for opening the dispute flow. |
| `onReleaseFunds` | `() => void` | No | Callback for releasing escrow funds. |
| `onViewSummary` | `() => void` | No | Callback for viewing the completed contract summary. |
| `disabledReasons` | `ActionPanelDisabledReasons` | No | Disables specific visible actions globally and exposes the provided reason through `aria-describedby` (e.g. `submitMilestone`, `releaseFunds`, `dispute`, `viewSummary`). |
| `errorMessage` | `string` | No | Announces transient API or network errors with a `role="alert"` region rendered above the actions. |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | No | Disables all visible actions while contract or wallet state is loading, providing a universal screen-reader loading reason. |

## Aria Descriptions & Disabled Reasons

The `ActionPanel` manages accessibility heavily through `aria-describedby` for disabled buttons, allowing screen reader users to understand *why* an action cannot be performed:

- **`isLoading`**: When `true`, it renders a hidden span with `id="action-panel-loading-reason"` containing "Action is disabled while contract data is loading." All visible buttons point to this ID via `aria-describedby`.
- **`disabledReasons`**: If `isLoading` is false, the panel checks `disabledReasons` for each action key (e.g., `submitMilestone`). If a reason string is provided, a hidden span is rendered with `id="action-panel-${key}-reason"`, and the button points to this ID via `aria-describedby`.

**Note on Wallet Gating**: Buttons are automatically disabled and receive a `title` (tooltip) if `isWalletConnected` is false, overriding individual `disabledReasons` visually but still preserving the accessible structure.

## Accessibility

- Buttons use browser-native keyboard support for `Tab`, `Enter`, and `Space`.
- Visible focus rings use high-contrast Tailwind `focus-visible:outline` utilities and are not removed in any state.
- Actions are rendered in contract workflow order: submit milestone, release funds, dispute, then summary when applicable.
- Submit Milestone opens the shared confirmation dialog before invoking the callback, then shows a success toast once the action is confirmed.
- Unavailable actions stay visible as disabled buttons with an accessible reason. Use `disabledReasons` for states such as no wallet, missing permissions, pending API responses, or unmet milestone conditions.
- Loading states disable all visible actions and describe that contract data is still loading.
- Error states are announced through `role="alert"` without moving focus or changing the action order.
- **Dispute Reason Character Counter**: The character counter in the inline dispute form is associated with the textarea via `aria-describedby` (`id="dispute-reason-counter"`). The remaining count is announced to screen reader users using an `aria-live` region:
  - **Debouncing/Throttling**: To avoid screen reader spam, updates are debounced by `1000ms` when typing non-boundary characters. Immediate announcements occur when pausing typing, or when crossing meaningful boundaries (multiples of 50, multiples of 10 when remaining count is $\le 50$, or every character when $\le 10$).
  - **Assertive Escalation**: The live region defaults to `aria-live="polite"`, but escalates to `aria-live="assertive"` when within the threshold of $50$ characters or fewer remaining.
  - **Clean State**: The live region is only rendered when the form is open, ensuring it remains quiet when closed.

## Focus Restoration

When a confirmation-gated action (Submit Milestone, Release Funds, Dispute) opens the `ConfirmDialog`, focus moves into the dialog per the ARIA dialog pattern. When the dialog closes — by confirming, cancelling, or pressing Escape — focus is restored to the button that originally opened it.

**Implementation detail:** `handleOpenConfirm` captures `event.currentTarget` into a `triggerElementRef` at the moment the button is clicked. Both `handleConfirm` and `handleCancel` call `triggerElementRef.current?.focus()` after clearing the dialog state. This is intentionally done via event capture rather than static `ref` props on each button, which would cause the last-rendered button to always win when multiple confirmation-gated buttons are visible at the same time (e.g. Release Funds and Dispute on `Active`/`Pending` status).

```
User clicks "Release Funds"
  → handleOpenConfirm('release', event)
  → triggerElementRef.current = event.currentTarget  ← captured here
  → dialog opens, focus moves to Cancel button

User clicks Cancel (or presses Escape)
  → handleCancel()
  → setConfirmAction(null)       ← dialog unmounts
  → triggerElementRef.current?.focus()  ← focus back to Release Funds ✓
```

This satisfies WCAG 2.1 SC 3.2.2 (On Input) and the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide dialog pattern requirement that focus returns to the triggering element after dialog dismissal.



| Status | Visible actions |
|--------|-----------------|
| `Active` | Submit Milestone, Release Funds, Dispute |
| `Pending` | Release Funds, Dispute |
| `Disputed` | Dispute |
| `Completed` | View Summary |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import ActionPanel from '@/components/ActionPanel';

export default function ContractDetail({ contractData, isLoading, errorMessage }) {
  const handleSubmitMilestone = () => { /* ... */ };
  const handleReleaseFunds = () => { /* ... */ };
  const handleDispute = () => { /* ... */ };
  const handleViewSummary = () => { /* ... */ };

  return (
    <ActionPanel
      status={contractData?.status || 'Active'}
      onSubmitMilestone={handleSubmitMilestone}
      onReleaseFunds={handleReleaseFunds}
      onDispute={handleDispute}
      onViewSummary={handleViewSummary}
      isLoading={isLoading}
      errorMessage={errorMessage}
      disabledReasons={{
        submitMilestone: !contractData?.canSubmit ? 'You do not have permission to submit milestones.' : undefined,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Testing Notes

The component tests cover:

- Action rendering and callback behavior for active and completed contracts.
- Confirmable Submit Milestone, including success toast feedback and cancel/disconnected-wallet cases.
- Logical button order for keyboard navigation.
- Visible focus ring classes on every enabled action.
- Disabled action semantics and screen-reader descriptions.
- Loading, slow-network error, and missing-handler edge cases.
- **Focus restoration:** After cancel, confirm, or Escape on each confirmation-gated action, focus lands on the exact button that opened the dialog — asserting Release Funds and Dispute are correctly distinguished even when both are rendered simultaneously.
