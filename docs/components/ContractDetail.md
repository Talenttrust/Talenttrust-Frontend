# Contract Detail Components

This page uses a set of reusable components to present contract metadata, milestone progress, and context-aware actions. The page implements loading and error states via skeleton placeholders and error messaging wired to ActionPanel.

## Components

### `ContractSummary`

Props:
- `contractName: string`
- `parties: { label: string; address: string }[]`
- `totalValue: number`
- `currency: string`
- `status: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Disputed' | 'Pending'`
- `createdAt: string`
- `milestoneCount: number`

Description: Displays the contract name, current status badge, total value, creation date, and key parties with middle-truncated addresses.

### `ContractProgress`

Props:
- `milestones: Milestone[]`

Description: Derives escrow metrics directly from the contract's milestone array and renders an accessible progress panel with a `role="progressbar"` indicator and paid/outstanding fund cards. Currency is taken from the milestones themselves — no value is hardcoded on the page. An empty `milestones` array renders a safe zero-state (0 / 0, 0% progress) without throwing.

The component is placed between `ContractSummary` and `MilestonesList` in the left column and wrapped in its own `SafeBoundary`. During data loading a `ContractProgressSkeleton` is shown in its place.

See [`docs/components/ContractProgress.md`](./ContractProgress.md) for the full data-calculation spec and ARIA attribute table.

### `MilestonesList`

Props:
- `milestones: Array<{ id: string; title: string; status: 'Pending' | 'Completed' | 'Paid' | 'Disputed'; payout: number; currency: string; dueDate?: string; }>`
- `contractCurrency?: string` — optional contract-level currency. When provided, milestones whose currency differs (case-insensitive) trigger an accessible `role="alert"` warning banner near the milestones list identifying which and how many milestones mismatch.

Description: Renders a scrollable milestone roster, each showing the title, due date, status, and payout amount. When `contractCurrency` is provided, the component uses `findCurrencyMismatches` from `src/lib/currencyMismatch.ts` to detect and surface currency mismatches.

### `ActionPanel`

Props:
- `status: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Disputed' | 'Pending'`
- `onSubmitMilestone?: () => void`
- `onDispute?: () => void`
- `onReleaseFunds?: () => void`
- `onViewSummary?: () => void`
- `disabledReasons?: Partial<Record<ActionKey, string>>`
- `errorMessage?: string`
- `isLoading?: boolean`

Description: Chooses appropriate action buttons based on the current contract status. See `docs/components/ActionPanel.md` for keyboard support, disabled-state reasons, loading, and error guidance.

### `ContractSummarySkeleton`

Description: Renders a placeholder skeleton for `ContractSummary` while contract data is loading. Uses `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-label="Loading contract summary"` for accessibility announcement.

### `ContractProgressSkeleton`

Description: Renders a placeholder skeleton for `ContractProgress` while contract data is loading. Uses `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-label="Loading escrow progress"` for accessibility announcement. Mirrors the visual shape of `ContractProgress` with pulsing grey blocks for the progress bar and both fund cards.

### `MilestonesListSkeleton`

Description: Renders a placeholder skeleton for `MilestonesList` while milestones are loading. Uses `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-label="Loading milestones"` for accessibility announcement.

## Data Resolver

The `resolveContractData` function (in `src/lib/contractResolver.ts`) provides a typed, deterministic async interface for contract data. It accepts an optional config object with `simulateError` and `simulateDelay` flags for testing.

```typescript
export async function resolveContractData(
  id: string,
  options: ResolverOptions = {}
): Promise<ContractData>
```

In production, replace the mock implementation with a real API call. The return type is `ContractData`, which includes all fields needed by `ContractSummary`, `MilestonesList`, and `ActionPanel`.

## Loading and Error States

- **Loading:** While data is resolving, skeleton placeholders display for `ContractSummary` and `MilestonesList`. `ActionPanel` receives `isLoading={true}`, which disables all buttons and announces a reason to screen readers.
- **Error:** If data resolution fails, `ActionPanel` displays an error message with `role="alert"`. Buttons remain disabled. Components are wrapped in `SafeBoundary` to catch render errors.

## Adding a new action type

1. Update the `ActionPanelProps` type to include the callback for the new action.
2. Extend the `getActionButtons` helper inside `ActionPanel.tsx` with the new status-to-action mapping.
3. Add a new button render block in `ActionPanel` that uses the callback and descriptive `aria-label`.
4. Add unit tests in `src/components/__tests__/ActionPanel.test.tsx` to verify the new action appears for the correct status and that the callback triggers.

## Route parameter validation

The `id` route parameter is validated by `isValidContractId` (defined in `src/lib/validateContractId.ts`) before it is used anywhere on the page.

Rules enforced:
- **Non-empty** — an empty string is rejected.
- **Allowed charset** — only alphanumeric characters (`a–z`, `A–Z`, `0–9`), hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`) are accepted. Slashes, angle brackets, null bytes, and other special characters are all rejected.
- **Max length** — at most 64 characters. Oversized values are rejected.

If the id fails any rule, Next.js `notFound()` is called immediately and the existing not-found UI is shown. The raw param value is never rendered or forwarded.

## Layout

The contract detail page uses a responsive grid:
- Desktop: a two-column layout with summary, escrow progress, and milestones on the left, and a sticky action panel on the right.
- Mobile: stacked content to keep text readable and controls accessible.

Left column order (top → bottom):
1. `ContractSummary` — contract name, status, total value, parties
2. `ContractProgress` — escrow progress bar, paid/outstanding fund cards
3. `MilestonesList` — scrollable per-milestone detail rows

## Print View and Archiving

The contract detail page includes a print action and dedicated `@media print` stylesheet rules to allow archiving contracts as clean, legible one-page records.

### Print Action

- A **"Print contract"** button is located in the header of `src/app/contracts/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Triggering the button executes `window.print()`.
- The print button is wrapped in the `no-print` CSS class and excluded from print output (`display: none !important`).

### Print Stylesheet (`@media print` in `src/app/globals.css`)

- **Element Exclusion:** Hides interactive and non-record controls, including navigation bars (`header`, `nav`), `ActionPanel` (`aside`), mobile action menus, theme controls, breadcrumbs, and non-print buttons.
- **Address Expansion:** Overrides CSS truncation (`.truncate`) so full wallet/party addresses are displayed without clipping.
- **High-Contrast Status Badges:** Forces `StatusBadge` elements (`[role="status"]`) to render with high-contrast black text on a white background with a solid 1.5px black border for maximum legibility when printed or exported as PDF.
- **Single-Page Optimization:** Removes heavy drop-shadows (`box-shadow: none`), resets page margins/padding, and collapses grid layouts to present a clean, continuous flow suitable for a single-page document.

## Accessibility

- Status badges use high contrast color combinations (with print-specific black/white borders for high contrast when printed).
- Buttons include descriptive `aria-label` attributes, visible focus rings, and disabled-state descriptions.
- Section headers use semantic landmarks and visible labels.
