# Persistence API and Data Model Guide

## Overview
The client-side persistence layer for TalentTrust, located in `src/lib/repository.ts`, acts as the single source of truth for contracts and milestones. It provides a synchronous, SSR-safe mechanism for storing data in the browser's `localStorage` using a centralized namespace. This document details the data shape, security semantics, and how different pages in the application consume the repository API.

## Storage Namespace and AppData Shape
The repository uses a single `localStorage` key to store the complete state:
- **`STORAGE_KEY`**: `'talenttrust_app_data'`

The data adheres to the following `AppData` interface shape defined in the repository:
```typescript
interface AppData {
  contracts: Contract[];
  milestones: Milestone[];
}
```

The constituent types (`Contract` and `Milestone`) are strictly defined in `src/types/domain.ts` and represent the canonical structure used throughout the frontend components.

### Linking milestones to a parent contract
`Milestone` carries an optional `contractId?: string` field (defined alongside the rest of the shape in `src/components/MilestonesList.tsx`) that associates a milestone with the `Contract` it belongs to. The field is optional so existing milestones created without a contract context (e.g. the standalone [Milestones Page](../src/app/milestones/page.tsx) flow) remain valid.

`MilestoneCreationForm` (`src/components/milestones/MilestoneCreationForm.tsx`) accepts an optional `contractId` prop; when a caller renders the form from a contract detail context and passes that contract's id, the constructed `Milestone` is stamped with it on submit so it can later be resolved via `listMilestonesByContract`.

## SSR Safety & Resilience
The repository is designed to be fully safe for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js:
- **`window` existence checks**: All access to `localStorage` is guarded by verifying that `typeof window !== 'undefined'`. This ensures Next.js server builds and prerendering processes do not crash.
- **Empty-state fallback**: When the storage key is missing, unparseable, or during SSR, the repository gracefully catches any errors and returns a resilient empty fallback: `{ contracts: [], milestones: [] }`.

## Public API

The repository exposes a synchronous public API that can be consumed directly by React components, forms, and hooks. 

### Contracts API

#### `listContracts(): Contract[]`
Returns all persisted contracts. If `localStorage` is unavailable or corrupt, returns an empty array.
```typescript
import { listContracts } from '@/lib/repository';
const contracts = listContracts();
```
*Consumed by: [Contracts Page](../src/app/contracts/page.tsx)*

#### `saveContract(contract: Contract): void`
Appends a contract to the persisted list.
```typescript
import { saveContract } from '@/lib/repository';
saveContract({
  contractName: 'Design Sprint',
  parties: [{ label: 'Client', address: 'GAI3GJ2Q3B35AOZJ36C4ANE3HSS4NK7DV6JHBFMMOBJ3K27U6IGCUQ4A' }],
  totalValue: 5000,
  currency: 'USD',
  status: 'Active',
  createdAt: '2025-01-01',
  milestoneCount: 3,
});
```

### Milestones API

#### `listMilestones(): Milestone[]`
Returns all persisted milestones.
```typescript
import { listMilestones } from '@/lib/repository';
const milestones = listMilestones();
```
*Consumed by: [Milestones Page](../src/app/milestones/page.tsx)* (which implements a fallback to sample data when the repository is empty).

#### `listMilestonesByContract(contractId: string): Milestone[]`
Returns every persisted milestone whose `contractId` matches the given `contractId`. Milestones saved without a `contractId` (legacy records, or ones created outside a contract context) never match, since `undefined` cannot equal a supplied `contractId` string — including when an empty string is passed.
```typescript
import { listMilestonesByContract } from '@/lib/repository';
const milestones = listMilestonesByContract('contract-123');
```
*Consumed by: [Contract Detail Page](../src/app/contracts/[id]/page.tsx)*, which merges these with the milestones returned by `resolveContractData` (de-duplicated by `id`, persisted records taking precedence) before rendering `MilestonesList` and feeding the combined list into `useContractProgress`.

#### `saveMilestone(milestone: Milestone): void`
Appends a milestone to the persisted list.
```typescript
import { saveMilestone } from '@/lib/repository';
saveMilestone({
  id: 'ms-1',
  title: 'Project Kickoff',
  status: 'Pending',
  payout: 1000,
  currency: 'USD',
  dueDate: 'Jun 1, 2025',
  contractId: 'contract-123',
});
```

### Update Operations
The public API includes both additive writes (appending to arrays) and atomic upserts.

#### `upsertContract(contract: Contract): boolean`
Inserts or updates a contract in the persisted list:
- **Append branch**: When no contract matches the same `contractName`, the contract is appended to the end of the array.
- **Replace branch**: When an existing contract matches the same `contractName`, it is replaced in-place, preserving the existing array order and avoiding duplicates. In the case of multiple same-name candidates, only the first matching contract is replaced.
- **Milestones isolation**: Milestones data and other contracts are preserved completely unchanged.
- **Error reporting**: If `window.localStorage.setItem` throws (e.g. storage quota exceeded) or in SSR contexts, the failure is reported to the central `reportError` reporter and `false` is returned; otherwise, `true` is returned.

```typescript
import { upsertContract } from '@/lib/repository';
const ok = upsertContract({ ...existingContract, status: 'Completed' });
```

---

### Maintenance Helpers

The following helpers provide safe, SSR-aware paths for resetting persisted state. They route through the same `isBrowser()` guard and `reportError` plumbing as every other repository operation and **never throw**.

#### `clearAppData(): boolean`
Removes the single `STORAGE_KEY` (`talenttrust_app_data`) entry, effectively resetting all persisted contracts **and** milestones in a single call.

- Returns `true` when the item is successfully removed (including when the key did not exist — `removeItem` is idempotent).
- Returns `false` in SSR contexts (no `window`) or when `localStorage.removeItem` throws; errors are forwarded to the central `reportError` reporter.

```typescript
import { clearAppData } from '@/lib/repository';

// User clicks “Reset all data”
const ok = clearAppData();
if (!ok) toast.error('Could not clear persisted data.');
```

**Typical use cases:** unit-test teardown, demo resets, and user-initiated “start over” flows.

#### `clearByPrefix(prefix: string): number`
Removes every `localStorage` key whose name **starts with** the given `prefix` and returns the count of keys that were successfully deleted.

- Iterates over a **snapshot** of the key list so that removing a key during iteration can never cause index-shift bugs.
- Never touches keys that do not start with `prefix` — prefix scoping is strictly enforced.
- Returns `0` in SSR contexts or when no keys match the prefix.
- Individual removal errors are reported via `reportError`; the function continues with the remaining keys and does not count failed removals.

```typescript
import { clearByPrefix } from '@/lib/repository';

// Remove every TalentTrust key (e.g. during integration-test teardown)
const removed = clearByPrefix('talenttrust_');
console.log(`Cleared ${removed} localStorage entries.`);
```

> **Warning:** Passing an empty string (`''`) will match **all** localStorage keys.
> Always use an intentionally scoped prefix.

## Security Profile
- **Non-sensitive data only:** Only display-level, non-sensitive metadata (contract names, statuses, public wallet addresses) is persisted. 
- **No private keys or PII:** Absolutely no private keys, passwords, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are stored in this layer.
- **Client-only boundaries:** Data never leaves the device through this module, making it secure against cross-origin data leakage given the frontend's strict CSP boundaries.
- **Prefix scoping:** `clearByPrefix` strictly checks `String.prototype.startsWith` and never removes keys outside the supplied prefix. Callers must supply a meaningful prefix; an empty string `''` will match every localStorage key.
