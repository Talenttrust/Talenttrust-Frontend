Route failure recovery — contracts loading fallback & sitemap
Reference for the two deterministic failure-recovery contracts introduced in
src/app/contracts/loading.tsx (#1166) and src/app/sitemap.ts (#1256).

Both files answer a single question: when something goes wrong on a route,
what does the user (or the operator) see, and is that answer stable?

1. /contracts loading fallback
Code: src/app/contracts/loading.tsx,
src/app/contracts/ContractsLoadingBoundary.tsx
Tests: src/app/contracts/__tests__/loading.test.tsx

Phase	Rendered	Reported
pending	shared ContractsSkeleton + one polite live region	—
pending + stalled	skeleton stays mounted, plus a reload affordance	CONTRACTS_LOADING_STALLED at warn
failed	role="alert", "Try again" (or "Reload page"), "Go home"	CONTRACTS_LOADING_FAILED at error
Invariants
#	Invariant	Where
I1	The boundary never reads, writes or clears persisted storage, and never remounts anything above itself — a failure/retry cycle cannot lose contracts, milestones, wallet items or preferences	leaves persisted storage byte-identical…
I2	Retry is re-entrancy safe: concurrent activations yield exactly one transition (retryInFlight latch, counter incremented outside the state updater)	applies at most one transition for two concurrent retry activations
I3	Retries are bounded by MAX_IN_BOUNDARY_RETRIES (3); after that only a hard reload can recover. The counter lives on the instance, not in state, so getDerivedStateFromError cannot reset the budget	bounds retries and falls back to a hard reload
I4	Error messages, stacks and component stacks are never rendered and never enter the report metadata	never leaks the thrown message into the DOM
I5	A stall is a warn, not a failure: the pending render may still succeed, so the skeleton stays and the state never claims an error	keeps the skeleton mounted so the page does not jump
I6	Exactly one polite live region exists; the stall escalates by changing its text	escalates to an actionable notice and re-announces politely
I7	The pending render reads no clock, randomness or environment, so two renders are byte-identical	renders deterministically
Why not a second <main>?
The root layout owns the single <main id="main-content"> landmark. The previous
fallback rendered its own <main>, producing a duplicate landmark (the class of
bug fixed for /milestones in #682). The wrapper is now a <div aria-busy="true">.

Why is the stall budget 30 s?
Long enough that a cold start on a slow connection never trips it, short enough
that a hung request is not an unrecoverable dead end. stallTimeoutMs <= 0 or
NaN disables the watchdog, which degrades to the previous behaviour rather
than escalating immediately.

2. /sitemap.xml
Code: src/app/sitemap.ts
Tests: src/app/__tests__/sitemap.test.ts

Resolution order
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, validated: must parse, must be http(s), must not
contain whitespace or control characters. A value the URL parser normalises
(https:/host, https:host) is accepted.
DEFAULT_SITE_URL (http://localhost:3000) — the pre-existing fallback,
emitted byte for byte as before.
Routes come from the frozen SITEMAP_ROUTES and are resolved relatively
against base + '/', so a base path (https://host/docs) is preserved and
no double slash can appear.
Invariants
#	Invariant	Where
S1	Every entry is an absolute http(s) URL with a host and no credentials — enforced on the resolver's output, not assumed	expectOnlyAbsoluteHttpUrls helper, rejects a resolver that leaks credentials…
S2	sitemap() never throws and always returns a serialisable document: a rejected route is dropped, a rejected base falls back, a throwing reporter or clock is contained, and an Invalid Date (which makes Next's XML serialiser throw) can never be emitted	never throws for any combination of hostile inputs, still returns a complete document when the injected reporter throws, never emits an Invalid Date even when the process clock itself is broken
S3	The document is never empty; the base entry is always emitted	always emits at least the base entry, even for an empty route list
S4	Declaration order preserved, duplicates collapsed to the first occurrence, document capped at SITEMAP_MAX_URLS (50 000)	collapses duplicates…, caps the document at the configured limit…
S5	One timestamp per document, captured once; SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH makes it reproducible, an unusable value falls back and is reported	shares one timestamp…, honours SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH…, consults the clock exactly once per document…
S6	Reports carry a stable code and the reason only — never the offending value (which can embed credentials, host or path). The dedupe key includes every discriminating field (code, reason, source, sanitised) so two distinct conditions can never collapse into one and be swallowed	reports a rejected base URL with the reason and never the offending value, distinguishes the two timestamp sources so neither is swallowed
S7	Reports are emitted once per distinct condition per process, so a hot route cannot flood logs or grow memory. The memo is bounded by the fixed vocabulary (16 signatures) and hard-capped at SITEMAP_MAX_REPORTED_CONDITIONS (64) with oldest-first eviction, so a future vocabulary mistake costs a repeated log line, never a leak	reports a misconfigured site URL once per process…, createSitemapReportMemo suite
S8	Isolation across invocations: every call returns a new array, new entry objects and a distinct Date per entry. Nothing aliases the clock's instance, SITEMAP_ROUTES or another document, so a consumer mutating one result — or two requests racing — cannot influence another	produces identical, independently owned documents for 50 interleaved calls, never aliases the injected clock…
S9	One input snapshot per document: NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL and SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH are read once, on entry, and the clock is invoked at most once. A changed environment is honoured by the very next call — there is no cache to go stale	never serves a stale or mixed document when the environment changes between racing calls, reflects a changed SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH or site URL on the very next call
Concurrency model
Next.js calls the default export once per GET /sitemap.xml in development
(and once per build worker in production, where the result is prerendered),
awaits it, and serialises the returned array without mutating it. The
function is synchronous, so two requests inside one process can never
interleave inside a build; what they can do is run back to back, share module
state, and hand their results to code that mutates them. S7–S9 are what make
that safe:

The only module state is the bounded report memo (createSitemapReportMemo).
Every read-modify-write on it is synchronous, and a condition is marked
before delivery so a reporter that throws is not retried on every request.
buildSitemap is pure given its options; the route passes it a module-level
memoised reporter and nothing else. There is no cached resolution, so a
changed NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL can never be served from a previous call.
__resetSitemapReportsForTests() clears the memo for suites that need to
observe first-occurrence reporting without isolating the module registry
(mirrors __resetRobotsResolverForTests).
Security notes
Scheme allowlist. javascript:, data:, file: and ftp: bases are
rejected — an unvalidated NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL previously flowed straight
into the served document.
No credential leakage. URL.origin cannot represent userinfo, a query or
a fragment, so the composed base cannot carry them. Their presence in the
configured value is still reported, because embedding credentials in a public
NEXT_PUBLIC_* variable is a configuration fault.
Route allowlist. Routes must match an RFC 3986 pchar allowlist and may
not contain ./../empty segments, so a route can never escape the base
directory or smuggle a query, fragment or encoded control character.
Path traversal. '/../etc/passwd' and '/nested/../escape' are dropped.
Production diagnosability. The default reporter is a no-op under
NODE_ENV=production, so a rejected site URL is additionally logged once via
console.warn — a sitemap silently serving localhost URLs to crawlers is a
real SEO bug that is otherwise invisible. Only the reason and the fallback are
printed.
Known follow-up (out of scope here)
src/app/robots.ts composes ${siteUrl}/sitemap.xml
from the same environment variable without validation, so it can still publish
a malformed sitemap reference. It is a separate route with its own public
interface and is intentionally untouched by this change.

Report codes
Code	Level	Meaning
CONTRACTS_LOADING_FAILED	error	The /contracts loading fallback subtree threw
CONTRACTS_LOADING_STALLED	warn	The fallback outlived its stall budget; the render may still succeed
SITEMAP_SITE_URL_REJECTED	warn	NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL was unusable; the default origin is in use
SITEMAP_SITE_URL_SANITIZED	warn	The value was usable but carried credentials, a query or a fragment
SITEMAP_ROUTE_DROPPED	warn	A route was invalid, unresolvable, or did not resolve to an absolute http(s) URL
SITEMAP_TRUNCATED	warn	The document hit the protocol URL limit
SITEMAP_INVALID_TIMESTAMP	warn	SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH or the injected clock was unusable
All of them flow through src/lib/errorReporter.ts,
so a host application can capture them with setErrorReporter.
